Exploratory Data Analysis with some sales data
Data is collected from kaggle.com
I started the analysis with exploring provided data.
By exploration I found sub_categories of products that cause loss.
By digging deeper I found that big discounts are the main reason of loss that's because the discount is much more than the profit margin.
